95,Anonymised,"Goodnight, I love you so much. Ill see you tomorrow",I Know this is really stupid but I just need someone to say it to so badly and this sub is the only place I can do it. I haven't had anyone message me goodnight in months,Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,7,Blinded,,lonely,10,37,3
96,Anonymised,Help,"I dont need anything, 
I dont need talking,
I dont need music,
I just need someone to hug my broken soul...

That's it.....a hug, a long, warm hug, to fix all the cold in my aching heart.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,1,Blinded,,lonely,1,34,3
97,Anonymised,"I'm doing good. I feel great, just lonely.","That feeling of loneliness is always gonna be there. Cut me loose. My eyes feel like melting I'm drained from crying every night. Some nights it really sinks in. Waking up hurts, when theres no one there for you to talk with. Enjoying life with someone is much better than living alone. Be here with me, just don't leave me here on my own. I don't want to believe in anything anymore. At this point, being a relationship will only be apart of a bucket list.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,0,Blinded,,lonely,8,86,3
98,Anonymised,Can‚Äôt get a girl friend,"I can‚Äôt get a girlfriend. Was in a relationship for 3 months then we broke up. I try to make friends with girls doesn‚Äôt work. Tried online dating, was horrible selfish people, robots and people that don‚Äôt respond.
I‚Äôm average looking guy. I‚Äôm socially appropriate when talking to girls and also fun, spontaneous, interesting. 
All the reddit post I read about things like this people respond oh you think your entitled... your selfish, you don‚Äôt treat girls right... etc
No I‚Äôm a guy that respects women, I‚Äôm nice, appropriate, interesting, even take risks. 
I have depression and anxiety too fwi. 
I just feel like I‚Äôm cursed and can‚Äôt get a girlfriend. I feel the loneliness in my body, in my heart. The need to just interact with the opposite sex. And no I don‚Äôt expect a girl to come and try to make me feel less lonely. Just me socializing her and spending time with her would make me feel better. Also, I would be as helpful as possible, I‚Äôm a positive person and would motivate her, take her on dates, etc",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,6,Blinded,,lonely,5,180,3
99,Anonymised,Quarantined with the wrong person,"I'm in day 2 of quarantine. I usually live alone, but my bf offered for me to move in with him and his parents for this quarantine so that they could pick up my groceries and prescriptions etc.

Well it's day 2 and I'm sleeping alone I'm the spare room again while he plays Xbox and ignores me again. If I wanted to be alone, I would have stayed at my house. I really needed some support during this time. 

I just feel so trapped and helpless, I wish I was with my family, but they are in another part of the country.

Anyone else feeling really alone during this period? How do you cope?",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,4,Blinded,,lonely,5,113,3
100,Anonymised,I don't want someone I can talk to; I want someone who will talk to me.,"Having someone text me first is a quite rare occurence. I don't want someone available for me but I want someone who will give me attention.

Sorry to all the good people who say, ""you can talk to me"", I know you're kind, and you are useful to many lonely and sad people, but *I* need someone to do more for me than just listen.

I've been loney for so long I don't know how to express myself to someone else.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,82,Blinded,,lonely,16,79,3
101,Anonymised,I just want someone to hug,"Or like cuddle, spend some time with, etc. Anything to get rid of this lonely feeling inside me.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,8,Blinded,,lonely,6,18,3
102,Anonymised,I feel like I threw away everything.,"She was a good friend to me. My dumb ass developed feelings for her, and even confessed. Who does that? Who says exactly what they‚Äôre thinking? What kind of game is that? 

Now, she‚Äôs not even my friend. She‚Äôs just, an image. I lost her. I can‚Äôt talk to her and I can‚Äôt think of her without feeling pain. Physical pain. Why did I do it? Why did I confess? Why did I throw away everything? EVERYTHING?",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,5,Blinded,,lonely,7,77,3

104,Anonymised,Trying to keep my chin up but the ship is beginning to sink.,"Hearing a lot of people complain about isolation after a few weeks of it. I have been isolated for years. I have bad days now and then. The bad days are becoming more frequent. I try to reach out but nothing comes of it. Things just are not working. Really they have never worked. I have even tried to help suicidal redditors on other subs. Often when they describe their ""hopeless"" social situation I find that I am envious as their social life is exponentially better than mine. My only real interactions with anybody is replying and posting on social media. I feel like I am losing my ability to cope.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,4,Blinded,,lonely,13,111,3
105,Anonymised,Done with trying to find a girlfriend,"I [21F] have been talking to this girl [19F] for a while. I didn‚Äôt really have much faith in this because I do, in fact, get ghosted by every single girl I‚Äôve tried to have a relationship with. But I am still heavily attracted to her and can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. A few days ago we agreed to go on a date once this coronavirus thing blows over. And then I find out from a two week old post on tiktok that she fell for a guy recently. I can‚Äôt compete with a guy. When girls compete with guys for the love and affection of a girl they always lose. Men have everything I don‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm not going to list these qualities because I don‚Äôt want to make this post NSFW. Attractive men also have this charm that makes girls swarm to them. I am average looking and not very charming so my chances of winning against this douchebag are slim. I should just accept I am always second choice and will never find a relationship. She‚Äôs super attractive and everyone who‚Äôs seen a picture of her has said I was lucky to be talking to a girl that attractive. Maybe I‚Äôm just a simp.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,2,Blinded,,lonely,7,207,3

107,Anonymised,Social distancing more like emotional distancing amirite guise?,"So lockdown got me realising that my normal habitual patterns of daily life is called ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù, amazing right?  
  
Upon hearing this news I thought I should come over here and see if anyone else is also doing a ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù and would like to participate?  
  
Our program can include anything from wholesome memes to socially degenerative shitposting, and if you play the vidya, it only expands the plethora of activities that are in store for my fellow lonesome breeds of leg walkers.  
  
If this sounds good to you, joining in is easy! Just get on the long thing and press the circle to make the light box, now, pick up the sweet thing and feel below the central point of vision for the face-hole, then, put the sweet thing in the hole and watch the light and you‚Äôll get the point!  
  
Many more wonders await in the Covid Cave and this limited invitation is just for you. If you prefer a sterile isolation, well that‚Äôs your right! But I‚Äôll be waitin‚Äô!

109,Anonymised,Loneliness as the only true way to be happy,"Is it only me that finds his biggest euphoria while being alone?! When you are with people and you share something you like , they might say they like it out of politeness but thats going to ruin your  mood like even more,  because lets be honest, they never are as passionate as you are at that particular moment. I love being alone , just because I do the things that I love with compromising anything, and i exploit my full self-sufficiency potential.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,5,Blinded,,lonely,9,85,3

117,Anonymised,My friend priotizes playing video game and watching anime to talking to me.,"I don't have many friends. I have a close friend whom I'm in touch with. I don't call him often probably once a week. When I go to meet him he's usually busy watching anime most of the time and today when I called him he ended the conversation in 5 minutes telling he was busy playing GTA vice city. I don't feel like he's a close friend anymore, probably more like an old friend.

119,Anonymised,I'm just drained of it all,I haven't been talked to for a while and my last gf got broken up by her parents. I just feel like a zombie going through the days. I miss my time with her and I wish I could see her again and talk to her. I just feel like a drained shell of what I used to be. I want that feeling of hope in my heart again and I want to find someone who cares about me and will care about what I have to say.

121,Anonymised,All my friends have s/os,"Hey, I‚Äôd like to formally invite you to my pity party.
I‚Äôm officially the last one of my friends to get a boyfriend. My friend let me know today and I instantly wanted to jump off a cliff, but instead I played the excited friend role and insisted she give me every painful detail. I imagine instantly bursting into tears would‚Äôve put a damper on her enthusiasm.

Now every time I meet with my friends, I can hear all the stories about how loved they all are. Or maybe they‚Äôll bring their boys and I can sit by myself, the seventh wheel.

It‚Äôs the shame that hurts the most. I feel like I‚Äôm failing because everyone else has got someone. I feel like I‚Äôm wrong because nobody wants me.
I wish someone was interested in hearing what I have to say. I wish someone would think I‚Äôm special for once. I‚Äôm so sick of being a background character in everyone else‚Äôs lives.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I‚Äôm gonna go cry myself to sleep.",Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,3,Blinded,,lonely,5,168,3

124,Anonymised,One of the things I hate about being lonely is that eventually I'll make a friend and fall for them,I have a great friend right now and I'm hoping he's just really friendly and doesn't like me back because we'd never work out and I don't want to lose him tbh,Blinded,Anonymised,1,Blinded,4,Blinded,,lonely,20,32,3
